# Proteome Comparison Service

## Overview

The bacterial Proteome Comparison Service performs protein sequence-based genome comparison using bidirectional BLASTP. This service allows users to select up to eight genomes, either public or private, and compare them to a user-selected or supplied reference genome. The proteome comparison result is displayed as an interactive circular genome view and is downloadable as a print-quality image or tabular comparison results.



## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).

This module provides the following application specfication:
* [GenomeComparison](app_specs/GenomeComparison.md)
